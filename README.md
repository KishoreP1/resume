# resume
Tracking how my resume changes using JSONresume. Feel free to fork and watch github actions automatically validate and build your resume on release.

The latest pdf build can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/lukew3/resume/releases/latest/download/lukew3_resume.pdf)

## Building
The release workflow will automatically build a pdf on release. If you want to render locally, you can use the `build.rb` file [here](https://github.com/lukew3/resume/blob/local-build/build.rb) and then run `pdflatex resume.tex`.
